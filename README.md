# Setup instructions for CERN mail

This is not a skill, it's scripts for setting up CERN mail for your agent.

**Put me in**: `~/.openclaw/workspace`:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
git clone git@github.com:HEPSkills/email_oauth2.git
```

**Begin setup**: Ask your agent to: Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/email_oauth2/OPENCLAW.md` and follow the instructions to setup CERN mail.
